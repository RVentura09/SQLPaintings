# SQLPaintings

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze data on paintings in museums, including information on artists, museum opening hours, and locations. The dataset consists of eight tables in a snowflake schema. Python was used for data preparation and initial upload to a MySQL server, with SQL employed for data extraction. Although the data is fictional, it is intended solely for practicing SQL queries.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in SQL, utilizing MySQL Workbench for database management and Python for data manipulation and uploading to the MySQL server.

## Content Description
- **Dataset**: The project includes eight `.csv` files that are used in the SQL queries. These datasets are extracted from Kaggle available at [Famous Paintings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings/data). Additionally, the `.ipynb` file contains the Python script for data manipulation and uploading to a MySQL server. To execute it, download the dataset and place it in the same folder as the notebook. Then, open the Jupyter Notebook, update the server credentials, and run the entire notebook.

- **SQL Queries**: There are a total of 15 queries designed to explore the previously mentioned dataset.
